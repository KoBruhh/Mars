**Gradient Descent**

Works fine. Green dots are the training data and red line is the models guesses.

try it by :
```
cargo run --example gradient_descent --release
```
-> It is **important** to use `--release` here, because training the model takes a lot more time compared to compilation time:

**So schenario goes like:**

without `--release` fast compilaton (+3 seconds) slow training (--much more than 3 seconds)

with `--release` slow compilation (-5 seconds) lot faster training (++much more time than 5 seconds)
